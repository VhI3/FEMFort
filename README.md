## Objectives

- Rewriting the Fortran 77 code using modern Fortran features.
- Improving code readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
- Enhancing the codebase with modern programming practices and idioms.
- Leveraging the capabilities of modern Fortran compilers and libraries.
- Providing comprehensive documentation and examples for the updated code.
